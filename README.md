# Technology stack

- Java
- JavaScript
- Maven
- JFreeChart
- JSP and 

# Problems solved by program

- program creates report about how well-fitted schedule is forecasted turnover.
- it gives sheet for whole store and every retail department,
- program takes schedule hours and forcasted turnover from two .xlsx files,
- names of department often vary in files (for exemple "Mountains" in one file can be "hiking" in another), program matches them.
- program sugest changes in schedule to better fit forecasted turnover,

# What I have learned  so far, in this project

- Apache POI,
- that dates are counted as days since 01.01.1900,
- testing by printing ends while project grows,
- proper naming matters, or You will lose it,
- class should be dedicated to specific actions
- mind-mapping helps to keep track of classes connections,
- but good-packages are better! 
- working with debugger,
- awt & Swing and finally: JavaFX,

BIG BREAK: Decision to go Web and my front-end struggle begins :)
My experience with front, thx to this project:

- JavaScript basics,
- JSP servlets,
- basics of Kanban in project management,
